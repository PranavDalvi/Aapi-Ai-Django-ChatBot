# How to run ChatBot on your computer 🤔
- To understand the steps given below, you should know how to create a new Django project and a Python virtual environment.
1. Download the required libraries from requirements.txt (Python virtual environment is required).
2. Create a new Django project. (why? Because we will need a `secret key` to run the project).
3. Open the newly created Django project and copy the full string of secret key from `settings.py`.
4. Now open the ChatBot project then open the project folder and create a new file named as `.env` and paste the secret key.
- .env file should look like this:
```
SECRET_KEY = 'dlm*zt#1-3g!xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
```
5. Do the migrations and run the project.
